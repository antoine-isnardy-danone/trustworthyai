Trustworthy AI

[Read time: 45 min]

At Danone, we aim to act responsibly, create and promote an AI that is lawful, ethical, inclusive and robust.
It is important to ensure the protection of fundamental (human) rights and user safety.

This document gathers a set of concrete guidelines, structured around 7 principles identified by the European Union
about AI trustworthiness. The reason why we tackle AI trustworthiness by complying with these principles is because we
believe they provide a precise overview of all dimensions involved in AI trustworthiness when it comes to developing an
AI system.

The primary audience of this document is AI practitioners, especially because it conveys a set of technical guidelines.
However, concepts are always introduced on a high level scale, before being tackled on a lower level - and technical -
scale. As a result, we strongly encourage non-AI practitioners to also read it.

This document acts as a practical asset about AI trustworthiness, especially dedicated to AI practitioners (advice,
practical methodologies, ...).

Some broader questions would still need to be answered while describing, evaluating and regulating the socio-technical
world surrounding AI:

- What are our dependencies ?

- How to make sense of our activity ?

- What do we participate in ?

- What are the shifts produced by our activity ?
